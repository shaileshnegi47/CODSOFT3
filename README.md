An ATM Interface is a user-friendly system that allows customers to interact with an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) for performing banking transactions. The interface typically includes a screen, buttons, card reader, and a cash dispenser. It provides options for users to check account balances, withdraw cash, transfer funds, deposit money, and perform other banking functions. The interface is designed to be intuitive and secure, guiding users through various transactions with clear instructions and prompts.
